# NBA-Player-Position-Classification

Traditionally, there are five basketball positions: point guard (PG), shooting guard (SG), small forward (SF), power forward (PF), and center (C). When created, these labels differentiated players roles. Centers, for example, grabbed rebounds and blocked shots. Over time, rule changes and the rise of analytics have allowed the NBA to develop into a high speed game with emphasis on the 3-point shot. The lines dividing positions have become increasingly blurred. These changes have sparked debate about the validity of the five-position system. Some argue that the traditional labels are archaic and should be redefined; others argue that they should be abolished. In this report, we use classification techniques to weigh in on this debate. Specifically, we investigate how well the five-position system captures playing styles, both historically and today.
